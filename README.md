# Zedtech: New Horizons Edition

A port of Zederrian Technology to GT: New Horizons' version of Gregtech, technically forked from [Tian_mi's Zederrian Technology GT5u.](https://github.com/MCTian-mi/Zederrian-Technology-GT5U). Changes things to be a slightly more rugged and desaturated style. All original textures were made by Zerrens and Tian_mi, any additional textures were created/repurposed by FyreofShadow or backported from Zedtech for Gregtech: Community Edition Unofficial for 1.12.2. 

THIS PACK REQUIRES OPTIFINE FOR IT TO WORK AS INTENDED. Certain connected textures do not work without Optifine installed so I highly highly recommend using it if you're going to download this pack.
 
Works very well on top of theCyanideX's Unity. I personally recommend [Unity 1.3.2 for Minecraft 1.7.10.](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/unity/files/2369895)

This is a temporary readme, example images and description will be updated as time goes on.
